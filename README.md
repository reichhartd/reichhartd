# Documentation

For the fifth talk wasn’t a backend necessary, but the 6th talk “A scripting language for the backend” will be on 03.12.2020. So to submit my project, I coded a small backend, which is working together with the main part of the talk, the frontend.
In combination both repositories are examples of the Jamstack, and the frontend is performing a little healthcheck if the backend is available.

## Project setup

### Frontend

-   Clone this repository
-   The branch “assessment” needs to be selected
-   Execute the command `npm install` in the root folder, to install the dependencies
-   Execute the command `npm run start` in the root folder

### Backend

-   Clone the repository [https://github.com/reichhartd/reichhartd-backend](https://github.com/reichhartd/reichhartd-backend)
